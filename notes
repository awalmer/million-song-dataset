Notes along the way:

RStudio Set Up
  I have been using RStudio on my work server (web version of RStudio) for a couple years, and had set up Git version control on that right away, 
  but needed a refresher to do that locally on RStudio desktop on my personal machine. 
  Finally figured out why RStudio wasn't recognizing Git on my computer even though I had installed it. 
  
  This helped:

  Check in the R shell (terminal) whether git exists, then where it is
  git
  which git
  
  Told me the alternate version of the exec location (i had multiple ones saved / installed apparently)

Success! After setting up Git to be recognized by RStudio, I was able to connect it to this repo.
Yay for version control.
