Million Song Dataset | subsets and resources

I came across this project called the Million Song Dataset, but the website's (http://millionsongdataset.com/) link to download the data is no longer functioning. To be fair, the project was from 8 years ago. After searching around, I found a forum on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/g6zqmn/anyone_have_the_raw_h5_data_from_the_million_song/) asking if someone had the raw data, which led me to this GitHub repo: https://github.com/subha5gemini/MillionSongDataset

From that repo I downloaded a subset of the Million Song Dataset (10,000 rows) and a "cleaned" version by the developer. 

I'm going to try to work with this subset and see where that gets me.

Sidenote: I need to learn how to store and access a database. I've used SQL but only through work, where I connect to a DB through the work server. Need to learn how to do that locally!
